The final project for the Algorithms and Programming III course is a group project (minimum 2 and maximum 3 students per group) that aims to develop a solution to a real-world problem using analytical models and data sets of different formats. Each group must understand the problem, investigate its context and background, establish a working methodology, and propose performance metrics to evaluate progress. During development, students are expected to train and evaluate different analytical models. For each model, they must appropriately tune the hyperparameters and evaluate the results obtained based on predefined metrics. Each group must use the CRISP-DM methodology, which will be presented in the course, and adapt it to the needs of their project.
